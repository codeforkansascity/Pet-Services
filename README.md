# Pet-Services Directory

For pet owners, finding a veterinarian in their area who's affordable can be incredibly difficult, especially among low-income pet owners and in vet deserts, where often there are only one or two veterinarians for dozens of miles. This searchable database will catalog veterinarians in the KC metro and beyond, utilizing Spay and Neuter Kansas City's catalog of veterinarians, to provide options for pet owners. 

This directory will provide access to low-cost veterinary and other pet health services based on a user's location.

Hours, addresses, and specialties will all be included to take the guesswork out of building a relationship with a veterinarian to provide them the best. Pet-friendly spaces and events will also be included to make this a resource for all pet owners.

Built in Drupal 7. Uses a combination of Addressfield, Geofield and Geocoder to create maps.
